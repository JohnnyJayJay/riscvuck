# riscvuck

riscvuck ("RISC-fuck") is a brainfuck interpreter written in RISC-V assembly, mainly for educational purposes. It mostly follows the reference and guidelines provided by [brainfuck.org](http://brainfuck.org). However this implementation is technically not Turing-complete because the internal array size is static.
